            <span class = "italics">KnightLight</span> 
            is a tile-based 2D puzzle-platformer where you light your way through the dark world you have found yourself in. 
            This game was developed during my sophomore GAM 200-250 courses at DigiPen Institute of Technology. Which is designed to create 
            collaboration between designers and programmers in creating a C++ custom engine, and a game in said engine.<br />

            Our team <span class = "italics">Luminosity</span>, which we named after the game’s premise, consisted of five programmers and two designers. 
            Of which I was the producer and sole graphics programmer.<br />
            <br />
            Our programming team built an engine using Dear ImGui for its structure, integrating a wide range of features and components based 
            on the designers’ needs. I personally handled the rendering requirements for this engine. <br />

          <h2>Semester 1: Building the Graphics Foundation</h2>
          <p>
            <br /> 
            In the first semester, my efforts were concentrated on developing the foundational graphics components and optimizing the rendering system. 
            Ensuring the stability and scalability of the graphical features to support further development. <br /> 
            <br /> 
            <span class = "bold">Rendering System Development:</span> My first steps in the project were to design and implement the initial rendering pipeline 
            using OpenGL. This included setting up the rendering of basic sprites, tilemaps, and other needed visual elements to get the project up and running. 
            For example, one of the first things I made was the sprite component shown below.<br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <img src = "/media/Sprites.png" alt = "Sprite component screenshot" class = "gameDescriptionImage"  style = "width: 100%; margin-bottom: 3%;">   
          <p>
            <img src = "/media/DebugDrawing.png" alt = "Debug drawing screenshot" class = "gameDescriptionImage"  style = "width: 40%; float: right; margin-right: 1vw;">   
            <span class = "bold">Debugging Tools:</span> During this time I also created tools to visualize info and debug issues, such as bounding boxes and 
            light source icons, which streamlined development for the entire team. This was especially used by our physics programmer, who used these debugging 
            tools extensively to fix issues in the collision code. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <span class = "bold">Lighting System Failed Attempt:</span> Near the end of the first semester I began working on the development of 
            our lighting system, an integral part of <span class = "italics">KnightLight</span>. I conducted extensive research into 2D lighting algorithms created by others, aiming to find one 
            that aligned with our visual goals and technological constraints. While most algorithms fell short, either visually or technically, I eventually discovered 
            one that seemed like a good fit. <br />
            <br />
            <img src = "/media/OldBrokenLighting.png" alt = "Old Broken lighting screenshot" class = "gameDescriptionImage"  style = "width: 40%; float: left; margin-right: 1vw;">  
            As I implemented this lighting system, it appeared to work well and even successfully lit some scenes. However, I soon encountered a critical 
            limitation, the lighting system couldn’t illuminate walls as we needed. Due to the nature of this system, the lighting stopped at the wall instead of 
            fading nicely into it, as shown in the picture on the left. Making so the player lacked crucial information for platforming. On top of that, this 
            method struggled with complex or overlapping geometry, which led to unexpected results.<br />
            <br />
            I spent a fair amount of time attempting to modify the algorithm to achieve the necessary behavior. Despite my efforts, I realized that fixing the 
            algorithm would require more time and effort than it was worth, and the results were unlikely to meet our goals. By the end of the semester, I made
            the tough decision to scrap the existing implementation entirely. <br /> 
            <br />

          <h2>Semester 2: A New Lighting Solution and Polish</h2>
          <p>
            <br /> 
            As the second semester began my focus was set on reworking the lighting system, since its functionality was required for the success of <span class = "italics">KnightLight</span>. 
            After that hurdle I moved to smaller more scattered tasks, like optimizing performance, bug fixing and improving the usability of my systems for designers.<br /> 
            <br /> 
            <span class = "bold">Lighting System Implementation Success:</span> To start off this semester, I took a new approach to this problem: designing a lighting system from scratch. 
            This way the result could perfectly fit our needs, visually and technologically.<br /> 
            <br /> 
            To start I consulted a graphics professor available to me at DigiPen and with their help I came up with my own method. This system worked by shooting rays into the 
            game world in a compute shader, which could "pierce" as deeply as needed while fading to create the desired lighting effect. This method addressed the limitations of the 
            previous algorithm, producing the visual results we wanted consistently.<br /> 
            <br /> 
            <img src = "/media/FinalLighting.png" alt = "Lighting screenshot" class = "gameDescriptionImage"  style = "width: 40%; float: left; margin-right: 1vw;">  
            In addition, switching from a CPU-driven technique to a GPU-based solution drastically increased performance. Allowing the designers to use as many light sources as 
            they wanted.<br /> 
            <br /> 
            With these changes the lighting system now seamlessly blends with <span class = "italics">KnightLight's</span> gameplay and aesthetic, enhancing the player experience.<br /> 
            <br /> 
            This challenge taught me the importance of adaptability and creative problem-solving in game development. By recognizing when a solution isn’t working and being willing 
            to pivot, I was able to create a system that not only met but exceeded our original expectations.<br /> 
            <br /> 
            <img src = "/media/CameraShowcase.gif" alt = "Camera movement gif" class = "gameDescriptionImage"  style = "width: 50%; float: right; margin-left: 1vw;">  
            <span class = "bold">Camera Work:</span> During this semester I also spent some time adding functionality to my camera for our designers. I improved camera movement by introducing 
            clamping and object-following behaviors, ensuring the camera stays within intended limits while dynamically tracking key elements in the scene. Additionally, I added camera 
            shake functionality to add impactful feedback during key gameplay moments. These tools greatly helped designers create a smooth and polished visual experience for the player, 
            allowing them to focus on crafting engaging gameplay without worrying about camera issues detracting from the experience.<br />

          <h2>Reflection and Future Goals</h2>
          <p>
            <br /> 
            This project has been a pivotal experience in my growth as a graphics programmer and was the project that pushed me towards this career path. I’m particularly proud of the dynamic 2D 
            lighting system, which became a hallmark feature of <span class = "italics">KnightLight</span>. In addition to that the lighting's initial failure was an amazing learning experience, 
            that made its final result all the more satisfying.  <br /> 
            <br /> 
            However, there are always areas I would have loved to improve if given more time: <br /> 
            <br /> 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class = "boldmini">Maintainability:</span> Near the end of the project the team began a “crunch” to finish our goals in time. While this “crunch” was successful, my code quality suffered. What was written during 
               this time would be very hard to work off of if we ever continued the project. <br /> 
               <br /> 
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class = "boldmini">Efficiency:</span> While I generally feel good about the level of optimization in this project, there are areas where improvements should have been made given more time. For instance, rendering to textures 
              for the editor game screen is done poorly. However, since this feature was only used internally by the team within the editor, optimizing it was not a top priority. <br /> 
              <br /> 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While there are many more, those are the ones that stick out to me.
            <br />
           Overall, I’m excited to take on more challenging graphical systems and continue refining my skills! <br />
