<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>This code determines how many cells in a grid are covered by a specific number of overlapping rectangle, using a sweep line algorithm to avoid processing every cell individually. In given test cases the grid can be as large as 10^9*10^9, and contain up to 10^5 rectangles. The output is a map indicating how many cells are covered by exactly ùê∂ rectangles, modulo 7001.</p>


<h2>Details:</h2>
<p>1. Input Processing:</p>
<div class="inset">
<p>The code begins by reading rectangle data from a file. Each rectangle is defined by its top-left corner (<code>x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ</code>) and bottom-right corner (<code>x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ</code>). For each rectangle, two events are created:</p>
<ul><li>A start event at <code>y‚ÇÅ</code>, for a rectangle covering the x-range [<code>x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ</code>].</li>
<li>An end event at <code>y‚ÇÇ + 1</code>, for a rectangle un-covering the x-range [<code>x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ</code>].</li></ul>
<p>These events are stored in a multimap, which automatically sorts them by their y-coordinates. This ensures that the sweep line processes the events in the correct order, moving from top to bottom.</p>
</div>
<p>2. Sweep Line Algorithm:</p>
<div class="inset">
<p>The algorithm uses a "sweep line" to move down the grid and process events. It keeps track of overlap counts dynamically, avoiding the need to check every cell.</p>
<p>Tracking Overlaps:</p>
<div class="insetDeep"><p>A data structure called <code>LineData</code> keeps track of the number of overlaps at each x-coordinate using a vector. Additionally, it uses a hash map to count how many x-coordinates share the same overlap value (e.g., "10 x-coordinates have an overlap count of 1").</p></div>
<p>Processing Events:</p>
<div><ul><li>For a start event, the overlap count for all x-coordinates in the range [<code>x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ</code>] is incremented.</li>
<li>For an end event, the overlap count for the same range is decremented.</li>
<li>After adjusting overlap counts, the hash map is updated to reflect the new distribution of overlap counts.</li></ul></div> 
<p>Calculating Area Contributions:</p>
<div class="insetDeep"><p>Between events, the algorithm calculates the total area contributed by each overlap count. This is done by multiplying the number of x-coordinates with a specific overlap count by the vertical distance (difference in y-coordinates) between consecutive events. These contributions are added to the final result map, with all calculations performed modulo 7001 to prevent overflow.</p></div> 
<p>Efficiency:</p>
<div class="insetDeep"><p>The algorithm processes only the edges of rectangles (start and end events) and updates overlap counts directly, making it efficient even for large inputs.</p></div> 
</div>
<h3>3. Output:</h3>
<div class="inset"><p>The final output is a map where the keys are overlap counts, and the values indicate the total area covered by those counts, modulo 7001. (e.g., 500 cells with 0 overlaps, 230 cells with 1 overlaps, ect.) This approach ensures the solution is scalable and avoids unnecessary computations.</p></div>
